/**
 * Object Teams features demonstrated by this example:
 * ---------------------------------------------------
 * Team class as design pattern Facade: The team class reservations.Reservations 
 * provides a simple interface which hides the system complexity and minimizes 
 * the communication between reservation system and main class.
 * 
 * Role classes as Decorator: The role class Reservable decorates its base class 
 * StockItem by adding of reservation feature, thereby allowing to control the 
 * availability of items in the storage. The role class Item encloses its base class 
 * StockItem, forwards requests to its provided methods (callouts) and performs 
 * additional actions for its base class (callins), thereby allowing to regard 
 * the storage items as a part of an order list. So we can manage the items in 
 * the storage, discount them and give the alarm, if the item has been invalidated.
 * 
 * Team and role inheritance: The team class reservation.StockReservations inherits 
 * the role class Reservable from its super-team reservation.Reservations, the team 
 * class order.StockOrder inherits the role class Item from its super-team order.Order 
 * 
 * Declared lifting: The base object StockItem is explicitly lifted to its role object
 * in the team class methods (teams order.StockOrder and reservation.StockReservations).
 * 
 * Translation polymorphism: The base class StockItem plays two different roles 
 * in two different teams: Item in order.StockOrder and Reservable in 
 * reservation.StockReservations. The both role classes are not conform to each
 * other. By transfer of an object of type Item between two methods of the different 
 * team classes (order.StockOrder and reservation.StockReservations) the Item object
 * is implicitly lowered to its base object StockOrder following by declared lifting 
 * to the object of type Reservable. (see the data flow between Item.doReserve(int) and 
 * StockReservations.reserve(StockItem as Reservable,int))
 * 
 * Separation of team implementaion and role binding: The role classes Item and Reservable
 * are implemented in their enclosing teams order.Order and reservation.Reservations 
 * and bound to their base classes in the sub-teams order.StockOrder and
 * reservation.StockReservations. 
 *  
 * Callin and callout method binding: The essential adaptations are integrated using 
 * callin bindings. Note, that the roles also employ the style of callout bindings 
 * in order to access features of their base class.
 * 
 * 
 * Domain description:
 * -------------------
 * 
 * A generic storage functionality is implemented in the classes Storage and StockItem.
 * The order system is introduced in the team class order.Order, where the role Item is 
 * unbound. The team class reservation.Reservatoins realizes the storage management in
 * connection with the reservation of contained items. The base class storage.StockItem
 * plays a role of an order entry in the team order.StockOrder (Item) and the role of 
 * a reservable item in the team reservation.StockReservations (Reservable).
